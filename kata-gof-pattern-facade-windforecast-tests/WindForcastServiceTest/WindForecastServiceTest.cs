    /// The test uses a builder for each facade implementation. The task of the builder is to
    /// - set up the required mocks and associated data they should return
    /// - create an instance of the IWindForecastService facade under test including the wired mocks
    /// - assert that the mocked methods have been called as expected by
    ///   <seealso cref="IWindForecastService.GetWindForecastBeaufort" />
    ///
    /// The builder is controlled by the <seealso cref="TestDirector"/>, which offers
    /// high level methods for the test.
